# Car Rental Database Project

This project's main objective is to be able to take data as input (in this case csv files that contained information about cars, customers, etc.) and be able to process them and make a user interface that allows a user to pick and choose what kind of car they would like to rent and at what dates. Based on the the criteria, the Python script will choose from the database via SQL queries which cars would be most suitable for the customer.

# All relevant files will be included in the Code folder.
